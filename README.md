# TelvarSaver
ESO LUA addon 
The ultimate standalone IC telvar addon
This addon adds 2 major life savers and multiple timer savers to IC.

1) Auto Queue out of IC when you reach a certain telvar amount
2) Adds a keybind to queue out to drastically increase the speed you can leave IC. Without this addon, you have to open your alliance menu, scroll over to a campaign, and queue out, all while youre likely being attacked. This is a massive game changer, since with this addon you can basically hit your keybind and within 5-10ish seconds be out of IC safe and sound with your telvar.
3) Easily withdraw and deposit preset amounts of telvar from your bank (0,1k,10k) using the menu.
4) Automatically deposit or withdraw telvar to reach a custom amount from your settings menu when opening the bank. Could be used to always deposit all your telvar or always withdraw 10k for the 4x bonus.
5) Auto loot key fragments (now Imperial Fragments)
6) Skip bank dialog in IC and more!


All features are customizable from the settings menu.
Remember to bind the keybind for it in the settings and personalize your settings in the addon menu

Requirements:
*LibAddonMenu-2.0

Recommended that you also use an addon like kill counter to auto accept queue invites if you don't enable the auto queue accepter in Telvar Saver.
