# TelvarSaver
ESO LUA addon 
The ultimate standalone IC telvar addon without the clutter of others
This addon adds 2 major life savers to IC.

1) Auto Queue out of IC when you reach a certain telvar amount
2) Adds a keybind to queue out to drastically increase the speed you can leave IC. [B]Without[/B] this addon, you have to open your alliance menu, scroll over to a campaign, and queue out, all while youre likely being attacked. This is a massive game changer, since with this addon you can basically hit your keybind and within 5ish seconds be out of IC safe and sound with your telvar.
3) Easily withdraw and deposit set amounts of telvar from your bank. 

Remember to bind the keybind for it in the settings and personalize your settings in the addon menu

Recommended that you also use an addon like kill counter to auto accept queue invites.
